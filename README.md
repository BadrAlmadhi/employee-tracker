# employee-tracker (Backend project)


## Description 

This project is creating a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. 


- What was my motivation? 

I have created a command-line project to make it easier for company's to track, add, and view employees and departments. This will make the jobs easier for people such as managers and HR workers to keep track of their employees database without having to deal with the code. The only thing they need to do is to run the npm start for the application to start. 

- What I learned while making the project?

I have learned how to use the backend tools such as JavaScript, Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to build application that help people making their life easier. I have also learned how to use MySQL in javaScript by using the mysql2 package.

Go to server.js and open a terminal, make sure you install all packages by typing npm install and then run npm start to start application.
